app/database.py--------> file name // this file basically connects to database and returns a database object which uh can use for curd opetration
✅ What database.py does
This file connects your FastAPI backend to MongoDB.
It creates a client object → connection to MongoDB server.
It creates a database object → reference to a specific database.
It also creates collection objects → users, products, invoices.
These objects are used everywhere in your app to perform CRUD operations.



✅ What is a MongoDB Driver?
A MongoDB Driver is a software library that allows your programming language (Python, Java, C#, etc.) to talk to MongoDB.
Think of it like a translator between:
Your code
The MongoDB database

A MongoDB driver = the tool that lets your code communicate with MongoDB.

👉 In Python, the MongoDB drivers are:
PyMongo → normal (sync) driver
Motor → async driver (used in FastAPI)

What does a MongoDB driver do?
It gives you functions to: Connect to MongoDB, Insert data , Read data , do CURD operations


Imports Explanation
1️⃣ from motor.motor_asyncio import AsyncIOMotorClient
Imports Motor, the async version of the MongoDB driver.
AsyncIOMotorClient lets you connect to MongoDB using async/await.
Faster and non-blocking → perfect for FastAPI.

2️⃣ from decouple import config
Imports config function from python-decouple.
Allows you to read values from a .env file.

✅ What this code does (in short) database.py:
Imports Motor : (async MongoDB driver) to connect to MongoDB using async/await.
Reads environment variables : MONGO_URL and DB_NAME from .env file using decouple.
Creates a MongoDB client : using AsyncIOMotorClient(MONGO_URL).
Gets the database by name: db = client[DB_NAME].
Creates references to collections : (users, products, invoices) so you can use them for CRUD operations.
