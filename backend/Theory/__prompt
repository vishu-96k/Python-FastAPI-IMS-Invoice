Here you go — a clean, production-ready backend plan for your Inventory Management System + Smart Invoice Generator, using:

✅ FastAPI
✅ MongoDB Atlas (async driver: Motor)
✅ JWT Auth (Login + Signup)
✅ Products module (CRUD)
✅ Inventory Rent Calculation
✅ Invoice Generator Module
✅ Modular folder structure
✅ Simple explanation for each file & route

No frontend included (you said you'll build it later).
This is ONLY the backend blueprint + what each file does.

✅ 1. Final Folder Structure (Clean & Production-Friendly)
backend/
│── app/
│   │── main.py
│   │── config.py
│   │── database.py
│   │── utils/
│   │   │── auth.py

│   │   │── invoice_model.py
│   │

│   │   │── user_schema.py
│   │   │── product_schema.py
│   │   │── invoice_schema.py

│── .env

✅ 2. Simple Explanation — What Each Folder/File Does
main.py : Starts the FastAPI app and includes all routers.

config.py : Loads environment variables:
Mongo URL
JWT secret
Email SMTP config

database.py : Connects to MongoDB Atlas using async Motor.

utils/
General utilities:
hashing.py → hash/verify password
jwt_handler.py → encode/decode JWT token
auth.py → Auth dependency to protect routes

models/
MongoDB collection structure for:
Users
Products
Invoices
(These are MongoDB documents, not SQL tables)

schemas/
Pydantic validation models for API inputs/outputs.

routers/
All REST API routes:
auth_router → signup/login
product_router → CRUD operations
invoice_router → create invoice, list invoices, download, email

services/
Business logic:
invoice_service → calculate rent, create invoice record
pdf_service → generate PDF
email_service → send email

✅ 3. MongoDB Models (Simple & Interview-Friendly)
User Model
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  name: string,
  email: string,
  password: hashed string,
  created_at: datetime
}

Product Model
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  owner_id: ObjectId (user),
  name: string,
  description: string,
  price: number,
  quantity: number,
  created_at: datetime
}

Invoice Model
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  user_id: ObjectId,
  products: [ { productId, qty, price } ],
  total_rent: number,
  pdf_url: string,
  created_at: datetime,
  emailed: bool
}

✅ 4. API Routes You Need (Super Clean)
Auth Routes
Method	Route	Description
POST	/auth/signup	register new user
POST	/auth/login	login + get JWT

Product Routes : All product routes need JWT authentication.
Method	Route	Description
POST	/products/	create product
GET	/products/	list all products of logged-in user
GET	/products/{id}	get one product
PUT	/products/{id}	update product
DELETE	/products/{id}	delete product

Invoice Routes
Method	Route	Description
POST	/invoice/generate	generate invoice for selected products
GET	/invoice/	list all invoices
GET	/invoice/{id}	get single invoice
GET	/invoice/{id}/download	get PDF invoice
POST	/invoice/{id}/email	send invoice to customer

✅ 5. Rent Calculation Logic (your unique requirement)

How rent is calculated:

Rule:
Rent = sum of (product.price × quantity × 0.02)
(You can modify rate = 2% monthly/storage fee)

Example:
Mouse  ₹1000  qty=2 → 2000 x 0.02 = 40
Keyboard  ₹2000 qty=1 → 2000 x 0.02 = 40

Total Rent = ₹80

This logic will live inside:

services/invoice_service.py

✅ 6. How All Files Talk Together (Flow Diagram)
Authentication

React sends signup/login → FastAPI → Mongo → returns JWT
JWT protects all other APIs.

Products

User sends product → router → schema validation → MongoDB insert
Fetching also uses owner_id to filter.

Invoice Process
React → POST /invoice/generate
           ↓
Invoice service calculates rent
           ↓
PDF generator creates invoice.pdf
           ↓
Store in /static/invoices or S3
           ↓
Save invoice record in MongoDB
           ↓
Email service sends invoice (optional)

✅ 7. What You Should Build First (Backend Order)

Setup project + folder structure

Connect to MongoDB Atlas (database.py)

Build user auth (signup/login)

Build product CRUD

Build invoice logic + rent calculation

Build PDF generator (simple HTML → PDF)

Build email sending

Test everything using Thunder Client / Postman

I m done with the JWT wala part 
 I just have started making this applicaiton, like i have configured and conneceted to databse,  using the databs.py file and created the log in, sign, up routes and even implemented JWT in it even created the user _schema for data validation, now i need to Build product CRUD operations once the user is log in,which I will be veryfiying thorugh swagger, and as per now, I have the routes to be in my main.py only , after wards i will put them in the route folder 

my main.py looks like this :

and databse look likes :

and my user_schema :

thats it tell me step by step approach to do this, and what all files should be there, like I have
